# Advance-Encryption-Standard
This project implements the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for secure data encryption and decryption. It includes key expansion, substitution, shift operations, and round transformations for AES-128. The repository demonstrates the complete workflow of AES, including algorithm logic, code implementation, and test examples.
